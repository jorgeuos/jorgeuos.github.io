# Installing my first GH pages

Gots to learn right!?

* First Read the official [guide](https://pages.github.com/).
* Then I learned I could use [Hugo](). I love Go.
* I followed the Hugo [Geting started-guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
* Also how to install and deploy on Github. [install on Github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
* I chose a theme I liked from the [Hugo theme pages](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
*
