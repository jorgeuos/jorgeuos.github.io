Well, here it comes.
So my company decided that we were gonna join the We Are Developers conference in Berlin. Which I never had heard about before, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been to conferences in Berlin twice before. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a conference at the same venue before, CityCube, So I knew it was going to be a blast&amp;hellip; mostly I was looking forward to get a full night sleep after 2 years of having babies.</description></item></channel></rss>
